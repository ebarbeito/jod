jump or die THANKS file

Several people contributed to jump or die without writing code, may be by inspiring
me, reporting problems, suggesting improvements or submitting actual code.

Let's thank them here!

* Anthony Lewis (Tony)		http://anthonylewis.com/contact/
  For his article "Managing Game States in C++" (http://j.mp/1PanG8). The way to
  handle states in jump or die is based on this text.

* Ed (aka FlukeDude)		ed.s.bentley@gmail.com
  He made The Impossible Game for Xbox 360. Jump or die is just a clone of this
  great game, so thanks to him for a great idea and a great game. If you're
  lucky enough to own an Xbox 360, you could get The Impossible Game from
