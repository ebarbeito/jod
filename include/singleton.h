/** \brief Singleton template pattern.
 *
 * Allows to turn any new or existing class T into Singleton Pattern. It is
 * accomplished by deriving class T from class Singleton.
 *
 * It is assumed that Singleton objects are long-lived. Often they exist for the
 * life of the program. You delete them not so much to reclaim space but to shut
 * down in the orderly manner (such as return whatever  resources derived class
 * holds in its ownership back to the system). C++ deletes static objects
 * automatically. Although, it doesn't guarantee the calling order. In other
 * words, destructors of Singleton class are not order-dependent.
 *
 * To force destruction order, Singleton class transfers ownership of object T
 * to Destroyer class. When the program exits, the Destroyer will be destroyed,
 * and the object T along with it. Singleton destructor is now implicit.
